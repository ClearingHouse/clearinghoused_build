Using the Installer
===================

.. warning::

    Due to the current pace of ``clearinghoused`` development, at the current moment, we do not offer a ``clearinghoused``
    binary installer for windows. It is recommended that users instead follow the instructions in :doc:`BuildingFromSource`
    (which are really not that involved). The reason for this is because the Windows installer always lags
    current ``clearinghoused`` progress by a few days normally, and at this point in heavy development, this fact will
    most likely cause issues for its users. Building from source is the best way to keep up with the frequent updates.
    
    Another alternative is to use `BoottleXCP <https://github.com/ClearingHouse/BoottleXCH>`__.
